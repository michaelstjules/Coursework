My 2-3-4 tree is implemented as a B+ tree, with all items/keys on leaves,
as described in the notes.
I've included two theorems (with sketches of proofs) about 2-3-4 trees as B+ trees
(although the theorems could be extended to similar B+ trees of higher order).
The two theorems are obvious enough without proof by looking at a large 2-3-4 B+ tree.
